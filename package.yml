summary    : Proc::ProcessTable - Perl extension to access the unix process table
description: |
    Perl extension to access the unix process table. This module is a first crack at providing a consistent interface to Unix (and maybe other multitasking OS's) process table information. The impetus for this came about with my frustration at having to parse the output of various systems' ps commands to check whether specific processes were running on different boxes at a larged mixed Unix site. The output format of ps was different on each OS, and sometimes changed with each new release of an OS. Also, running a ps subprocess from within a perl or shell script and parsing the output was not a very efficient or aesthetic way to do things.
